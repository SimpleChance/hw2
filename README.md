### Programming Problem Notes

 For each programming problem, let us know:

 - How we should compile your code (`g++` command or `make` target)
		~make (no target)


 - Design decisions you made or other non-trivial choices for your implementation
		~none? Other than what was required

 - Any additional tests you wrote and what files those exist in
		~none.

 - Known errors/anything to help us grade (though we will run automated tests,
knowing what features may be broken/missing may help us provide some partial credit)
		setUnion and setIntersection may be incorrect, but I am not entirely sure. It would work for most of my test cases.
